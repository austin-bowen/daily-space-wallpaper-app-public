Daily Space Wallpaper App Privacy Policy

The Daily Space Wallpaper app ("the App") does not collect, use, or share user data.

The App communicates with the NASA API (https://api.nasa.gov/) to retrieve information about the current NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day, and to download the picture to set as the wallpaper; as such, the NASA API will receive and could potentially record information sent in those requests, but the App does not include any user data in the requests. Please refer to the NASA Web Privacy Policy (https://www.nasa.gov/about/highlights/HP_Privacy.html) for more information.
